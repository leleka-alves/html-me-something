      <p class="text"> Hi there! My name is Alessandra Alves. The idea of this project is to illustrate what a person can be.  
        Yeah! Who are you? Who are they? Very often, when I am walking around and observing random people. Some of them looking down. 
        Most of them with their eletronic devices and some others just looking straight ahead. I catch myself asking 
        what does that person do in life? What does he or she like? Do they work? Are they happy? What are their hobbies? Do they 
        have any special skills or talents? It might seem a little crazy but those are questions that keep popping my head. I am 
        curious about peoples lives. No, not gossip! :) I am interested on how people go day by day with their routines, dreams 
        and personal feelings. Nowadays life is very technologic, which I love, don't get me wrong! But also have this unfortunate 
        tendency to create distance between what we see from what really is and influence our judgments.

                  I have many hobbies. I love listening to  music and going to shows. I love going to the beach. I like to play games like Candy Crush and Megapolis.  
                  I really appreciate a nice conversation.  I enjoy doing my own nails. I like doing make up 
                  and some other girly stuff as well, but recently I really started enjoying something that definitely was not part of 
                  this list, and that would be cooking. I used to run away from the stove as cat runs away from the water, 
                  but lately I am giving a try to some stuff that I think is interesting. The other thing I really like is handcrafting and 
                  since one of my hobbies is also taking pictures, I love taking pictures of everything I do.

                  <p class="text">I have studied many things in my life. It is a funny thing. If you ask me if I like going to school, my 
                    automatic answer is going to be 'no', but when I have a purpose I do like to go deeper in the information in order to execute whatever I 
                    need to get done as perfect as it can be.

              <br><p class="text"> My favorite job was as an Operations Coordinator 
              where I had the chance to be engaged in functions I did not work previously and it happened to be the best ones for 
              me so far. 
              
              Working in this place as a Operations Coordinator gave me a great professional validation because I was a point of 
              contact of different departments, such as IT, administration, HR, the client and the directors of the company, 
              managing dashboards, analizing reports, providing workflow improvements by creating, updating and monitoring key 
              perfomance indicators and monitoring them through graphics. It was very rewarding actively participating and observing 
              the progress and on going results of an operation from the technologic perspective. 
              <br><br>
              It enchants me when you can unite knowledge, people, technology and tangible results!

             <br><p class="text">It is a very nice feeling to surprise or to create a moment to a person that you do not 
                  even know if you will see them again. 
                <br><br>
                I have done volunteer work to benefit people affected by natural disasters in New York. I have organized
                 walking and racing events in Sao Paulo to raise money for instituitions in need and I am also part of an institution in
                Brazil called "Presente de Alegria". In this institution we have to conclude a course to officially become a clown. 
                Yeah! A clown! You learn clown techniques in order to visit hospitals and orfanages and bring them happiness
                with games and creative activities. Emotionally speaking, it can be a 
                little overwhelming because you get to visit very sick people or kids in such a young age who has already soffered
                so many traumas and you can see everything in their eyeys while you are doing your best to give them a good
                experience, even if it is for a short period of time. <br>
                <br> I believe that every single person should go through the process of doing volunteer work at least once in their lives. 
                It is an experience hard to put into words. It is like going to an amazing place for vacation and trying to describe every little detail
                to a person that did not go with you. The only way for them to understand it is going to the place themselves.
