Hi there! My name is Alessandra Alves. The idea of this project is to illustrate what a person can be.  Yeah! Who are you? Who are they? Very often, when I am walking around and observing random people. Some of them looking down. Most of them with their eletronic devices and some others just looking straight ahead. I catch myself asking what does that person do in life? What does he or she like? Do they work? Are they happy? What are their hobbies? Do they have any special skills or talents? It might seem a little crazy but those are questions that keep popping my head. I am curious about peoples lives. No, not gossip! :) I am interested on how people go day by day with their routines, dreams and personal feelings. Nowadays life is very technologic, which I love, don't get me wrong! But also have this unfortunate tendency to create distance between what we see from what really is and influence our judgments. 

Based on this funny curiosity about who are these people crossing my path, I have decided to expose myself a little bit here to show a little bit of who I am and you can experience on your own if that is what you would have imagined. 


I am originally from Brazil. I have lived in Sao Paulo, New York and Florida. My native language is Portuguese. I also speak English, a 'still in progress' Spanish and I can understand Italian.



A little bit of sun, a little bit of sport, a little bit of sweat.
A little bit of animals, a little bit of laughter.
A little bit of vanity, a little bit of freedom, a little bit of nostalgia.
A little bit of color, a little bit of pain, a little bit of warmth, a little bit of love.
A little bit of sadness, a little bit of nature.
A little bit of air, a little bit of sea.
A little bit of food, a little bit of drink, a little bit of laziness, a little bit of joy.
A little bit of of me ... very little.
