Hi there! My name is Alessandra Alves. The idea of this project is to illustrate what a person can be.  Yeah! Who are you? Who are they? Very often, when I am walking around and observing random people. Some of them looking down. Most of them with their eletronic devices and some others just looking straight ahead. I catch myself asking what does that person do in life? What does he or she like? Do they work? Are they happy? What are their hobbies? Do they have any special skills or talents? It might seem a little crazy but those are questions that keep popping my head. I am curious about peoples lives. No, not gossip! :) I am interested on how people go day by day with their routines, dreams and personal feelings. Nowadays life is very technologic, which I love, don't get me wrong! But also have this unfortunate tendency to create distance between what we see from what really is and influence our judgments. 

Based on this funny curiosity about who are these people crossing my path, I have decided to expose myself a little bit here to show a little bit of who I am and you can experience on your own if that is what you would have imagined. 


I am originally from Brazil. I have lived in Sao Paulo, New York and Florida. My native language is Portuguese. I also speak English, a 'still in progress' Spanish and I can understand Italian.

I am a person that believe we all can learn anything through information and practice. Because of that, I have studies many things in my life. The list goes from HTML, Service Quality Management to Zumba instructor and Personal Trainer. 

From what I can remember, here are some courses I have done throughout my life:

Python
Project Management
Service Quality Management
Business Management
Leadership Development
English 
Spanish 
Insurance Workshops
HTML
DreamWeaver
Flash
Photoshop
Dashboards
Web Development
Import & Export Agent
Zumba Instructor
Personal Trainer certification

I have also worked in different types of industries and positions. My favorite one was as a Operations Coordinator where I had the chance to be exposed to a department I did not work previously and it happened to be the best one for me so far. The good validation of being the point of contact of IT department, the client and the directors of the company, managing dashboards, creating, updating and monitoring key perfomance indicators was very rewarding and observing the progress of an operation from the technologic perspective enchanted me! 









A little bit of sun, a little bit of sport, a little bit of sweat.
A little bit of animals, a little bit of laughter.
A little bit of vanity, a little bit of freedom, a little bit of nostalgia.
A little bit of color, a little bit of pain, a little bit of warmth, a little bit of love.
A little bit of sadness, a little bit of nature.
A little bit of air, a little bit of sea.
A little bit of food, a little bit of drink, a little bit of laziness, a little bit of joy.
A little bit of of me ... very little.
